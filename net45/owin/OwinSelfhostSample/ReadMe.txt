OwinSelfhostSample
----------------------

Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) defines an abstraction between .NET web servers and web applications. 
OWIN decouples the web application from the server, which makes OWIN ideal for self-hosting a web application 
in your own process, outside of IIS. In this sample, youï¿½ll use the Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener package,  
which provides an HTTP server that will be used to self-host OWIN applications.
